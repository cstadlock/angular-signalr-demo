# angular-signalr-demo

This branch, dotnetcore3.1-angular10, contains the original version of the SignalR + Angualr featured in my [blog post](https://mfcallahan.blog/2020/11/05/how-to-implement-signalr-in-a-net-core-angular-web-application/).  It was built with .NET Core 3.1 and Angular 10.  See the [master branch](https://github.com/mfcallahan/angular-signalr-demo/tree/master) for the most recent version of this app, which is built with .NET 5 and Angular 12.
